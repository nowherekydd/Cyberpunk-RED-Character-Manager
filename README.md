          Python-based CLI Character Sheet/Roller by nowherekydd // v0d

This is a little pet/passion project that I'm currently working on to add to my Python portfolio. As of right now an executable is not on the horizon, but hopefully once I have more free time I can get to it. If you've got knowledge on Python and know how to edit, feel free to download the source code and run it on your own machine.

Current features:
- Skill check menu divided by category
- Ability to re-roll a skill without having to redo category selection
- Debug output to check ability scores

In progress:
- Basic character sheet [think scores, skills, and HP]

Planned:
- Advanced character sheet
- Cyber references [possibly database?]

If you have any suggestions/comments, please feel free to let me know in any form of contact. I'm new to GitHub so I'm not quite sure how it works just yet.
